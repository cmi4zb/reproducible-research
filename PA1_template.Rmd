This is an R Markdown document for peer assessment 1 for reprodicible research.  


Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
activity<-read.csv(file="activity.csv",  header=TRUE,sep= ",", skipNul=TRUE)

```

packages need
```{r}

library(ggplot2)
```


graph of total number of steps taken per day

```{r}
ggplot(steps.day, aes(x = steps)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "blue", binwidth = 1000) + 
  labs(title="Frequency Steps Taken per Day", 
       x = "Number of Steps per Day", y = "Number of times ") + theme_bw()

```

mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
mean:10766.19
median:10765

```{r}
mean(steps.day$steps)
median(steps.day$steps)

```
average daily avtivity patttern

plot of the 5 minute intervals averaged across all days

```{r}
steps.interval.average<-aggregate(steps ~ interval, mean, data = activity, na.rm=TRUE)

barplot(steps.interval.average$steps, names.arg = steps.interval.average$interval, main="average steps by 5 min interval", 
        xlab="5 minute interval", ylab="steps")
```

5-minute interval of average across all the datas contained max number of steps
835

```{r}
steps.interval.average[which.max(steps.interval.average[,2]),1]

```

imputing missing values
current # of missing values you can see from summary: 2304
```{r}
summary(activity)
```

to fill in these missing values you can use the average interval value
```{r}

na_fill <- function(data, value) {
  na_index <- which(is.na(data$steps))
  na_replace <- unlist(lapply(na_index, FUN=function(idx){
    interval = data[idx,]$interval
    value[value$interval == interval,]$steps
  }))
  fill_steps <- data$steps
  fill_steps[na_index] <- na_replace
  fill_steps
}

newActivity <- data.frame(  steps = na_fill(activity, steps.interval.average),  
  date = activity$date,  interval = activity$interval)


summary(newActivity)

new.steps.day<-aggregate(steps ~ date, sum, data = newActivity, na.rm=TRUE)
```


histogram of the total number of steps (with imputed values)
```{r}
ggplot(new.steps.day, aes(x = steps)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "blue", binwidth = 1000) + 
  labs(title="Frequency Steps Taken per Day (with imputed values)", 
       x = "Number of Steps per Day", y = "Number of times") + theme_bw()

```

new mean and median values
new mean : 10766.19
new median: 10766.19
old mean: 10766.19
old median: 10765
The mean was not changed by the imputation.  However, the median was.  The median steps increased when the data was imputed.
```{r}
mean(new.steps.day$steps)
median(new.steps.day$steps)
```

Difference in Activity: weekday vs. weekend
make new variable

```{r}


newActivity$interval <- as.factor(newActivity$interval)
newActivity$date <- as.Date(newActivity$date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")

weekdays_steps <- function(data) {
  weekdays_steps <- aggregate(data$steps, by=list(interval = data$interval),
                              FUN=mean, na.rm=T)
  # convert to integers for plotting
  weekdays_steps$interval <-  as.integer(levels(weekdays_steps$interval)[weekdays_steps$interval])
  colnames(weekdays_steps) <- c("interval", "steps")
  weekdays_steps
}

data_by_weekdays <- function(data) {
  data$weekday <-  as.factor(weekdays(data$date)) # weekdays
  weekend_data <- subset(data, weekday %in% c("Saturday","Sunday"))
  weekday_data <- subset(data, !weekday %in% c("Saturday","Sunday"))
  
  weekend_steps <- weekdays_steps(weekend_data)
  weekday_steps <- weekdays_steps(weekday_data)
  
  weekend_steps$dayofweek <- rep("weekend", nrow(weekend_steps))
  weekday_steps$dayofweek <- rep("weekday", nrow(weekday_steps))
  
  data_by_weekdays <- rbind(weekend_steps, weekday_steps)
  data_by_weekdays$dayofweek <- as.factor(data_by_weekdays$dayofweek)
  data_by_weekdays
}

data_weekdays <- data_by_weekdays(newActivity)
```


plot difference
```{r}
ggplot(data_weekdays, aes(x=interval, y=steps)) + 
  geom_line(color="violet") + 
  facet_wrap(~ dayofweek, nrow=2, ncol=1) +
  labs(x="Interval", y="Number of steps") +
  theme_bw()
```
